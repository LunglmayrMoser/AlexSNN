# AlexSNN
This jupyter notebook contains python code for applying the Alexiewicz norm to the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model and SNNs:
(1) Quantization error based on Alexiewicz norm and its leaky variant, see [1].
(2) Evaluations regarding quasi isometry for LIF in analogy to threshold-based sampling, see [2] and [3]
